              The only person he is unable to cure, it seems, is himself. He has nursed a broken heart ever since the
              night, twenty-one years ago, when the love of his life fled Paris, leaving behind a handwritten letter
              that he has never dared read. His memories and his love have been gathering dust – until now.
              The arrival of an enigmatic new neighbour in his eccentric apartment building on Rue Montagnard inspires
              Jean to unlock his heart, unmoor the floating bookshop and set off for Provence, in search of the past and

              1946 Passing through Grand Central Station, New York, Grace Healey finds an abandoned suitcase tucked

              - and amidst the fireworks, an unmistakable sound rings out across Central Park. Gunshots. Two of them.
              The search for the shooter will bring together a rich cast of New Yorkers. From the reluctant heirs to one
              of the city's greatest fortunes to a couple of Long Island kids drawn to the punk scene downtown. From the
              newly arrived and enchanted to those so sick of the city they want to burn it to the ground.
              All these lives are connected to one another - and to the life that still clings to that body in the park.
              Whether they know it or not, they are bound up in the same story - a story where history and revolution,
              love and art, crime and conspiracy are all packed into a single shell, ready to explode.
              Then, on July 13, 1977, the lights go out in New York City.</p>

            <p> It's New York in the 1940s, where the martinis flow from cocktail hour till breakfast at Tiffany's. And
              nice girls don't, except, of course, for Holly Golightly: glittering socialite traveller, generally
              upwards, sometimes sideways and once in a while - down. Pursued by to Salvatore 'Sally' Tomato, the Mafia
              sugar-daddy doing life in Sing Sing and 'Rusty' Trawler, the blue-chinned, cuff-shooting millionaire man
              about women about town, Holly is a fragile eyeful of tawny hair and turned-up nose, a heart-breaker, a
              perplexer, a traveller, a tease. She is irrepressibly 'top banana in the shock deparment', and one of the
              shining flowers of American fiction. </p>

            <p> M Train begins in the tiny Greenwich Village café where Smith goes every morning for black coffee,
              ruminates on the world as it is and the world as it was, and writes in her notebook. Through prose that
              shifts fluidly between dreams and reality, past and present, and across a landscape of creative
              aspirations and inspirations, we travel to Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul in Mexico; to a meeting of an Arctic
              explorer's society in Berlin; to a ramshackle seaside bungalow in New York's Far Rockaway that Smith
              acquires just before Hurricane Sandy hits; and to the graves of Genet, Plath, Rimbaud and Mishima.
              Woven throughout are reflections on the writer's craft and on artistic creation. Here, too, are singular
              memories of Smith's life in Michigan and the irremediable loss of her husband, Fred Sonic Smith. Braiding
              despair with hope and consolation, illustrated with her signature Polaroids, M Train is a meditation on
              travel, detective shows, literature and coffee. It is a powerful, deeply moving book by one of the most
              remarkable artists at work today.</p>
